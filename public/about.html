<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Andr√°s Vranyecz, and I'm 21 years old. Currently, I am studying at university, majoring in vehicle engineering in English.</p>

<p>In addition to university, I work as an intern at Audi Hungaria Kft.<br /> I am involved in R4 petrol engine assembly and manufacturing on the production floor.<br />
My main responsibilities include production support, assistance in production line maintenance, and data analysis to prepare reports for the management.</p>

<p>During my work, I realized that the engineering path is not what I want to pursue in my life.<br />
I started researching and exploring different areas, and I came to the conclusion that I want to learn programming.<br />
I started working diligently to develop my skills to become employable.<br />
I began with learning Python, and while I am interested in Data Science, I stumbled upon web development and instantly fell in love with it.<br />
I still find the world of data fascinating, but I want to dedicate myself to web development on a daily basis.<br />
This introduction is a part of this ongoing journey.</p>
